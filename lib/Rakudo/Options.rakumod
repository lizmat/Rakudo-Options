=head1 NAME

Rakudo::Options - Rakudo Command Line Options

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use Rakudo::Options;

say "running with --ll-exception" if $*RAKUDO-OPTIONS.ll-exception;

say "running as a one liner" if $*RAKUDO-OPTIONS.e;

Rakudo::Options.new(program => "script").run;

if $*RAKUDO-OPTIONS.run-with-environment-variable(
  (MVM_SPESH_LOG => "log")
) -> $proc {
    say "Produced spesh log in '{"log".IO.absolute}'";
}

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Rakudo::Options is a multi-faceted tool, intended for Rakudo tool
builders.  It provides an API to the command line functions of the
currently running Rakudo process for introspection in a dynamic
variable C<$*RAKUDO-OPTIONS>.

It also allows you to create an adhoc object that allows you to
tweak values of the currently running Rakudo process to run (again).

=head1 DYNAMIC VARIABLE

Loading the C<Rakudo::Options> module, creates the C<$*RAKUDO-OPTIONS>
dynamic variable, which contains the settings of the currently running
Rakudo process (as a C<Rakudo::Options> object).

=head1 BUILD PARAMETERS

The following named arguments can be supplied to a call to C<.new>
to override what the currently running Rakudo process already
provides:

=item e

The Raku code that should be considered to have been specified with C<-e>.

=item encoding

The string of the C<--encoding> flag to be considered specified.

=item executable

String indicating the executable with which the process is supposed to
be running.

=item includes

The C<List> of The names of the directories that should be considered
to have been specified with C<-I>.

=item ll-exception

Whether the C<--ll-exception> flag is considered to be specified.
Expected to be a truthy / falsey value.

=item modules

The C<List> of  names of the modules that should be considered loaded
with C<-M>.

=item n

Whether the C<-n> flag is considered to be specified.  Expected to be
a truthy / falsey value.

=item optimize

The string of the C<--optimize> flag to be considered specified.

=item p

Whether the C<-p> flag is considered to be specified.  Expected to be
a truthy / falsey value.

=item profile

Whether the C<--profile> flag is to be specifiied.  Can be given as a
C<Bool>, or as a string (indicating the type of profile requested).

=item program

A string with the name of the script that is supposed to be running.

=item stagestats

Whether the C<--stagestats> flag is considered to be specified.
Expected to be a truthy / falsey value.

=item target

The string of the C<--target> flag to be considered specified.

=head1 ACCESSORS

Please note that all accessors return C<Empty> if they were not
considered to be specified.  This allows the accessors to also be
used as booleans.

Also note that all of the examples use the C<$*RAKUDO-OPTIONS>
dynamic variable, but that any ad-hoc created C<Rakudo::Options>
can also be used.

Also note that each of these attributes (with the exception of
C<e>, C<includes> and C<modules> can be uses "as is" as parameter
to the C<run> function, or as a parameter to the creation of a
C<Proc::Async> object.

=head2 e

The code that was considered to be specified with C<-e>.  If you
want to transparently run a script, or the C<-e> code, you should
use the C<.program> accessor.

=begin code :lang<raku>

say "running as a one-liner" if $*RAKUDO-OPTIONS;

=end code

=head2 encoding

    say "Specified '$encoding' for source files";
}

=end code

=head2 I

A C<List> of command line parameters of C<-I> specifications, to
be considered to have been specified.

=end code

=head2 ll-exception

=end code

=head2 M

A C<List> of command line parameters of C<-M> specifications, to

=begin code :lang<raku>

if $*RAKUDO-OPTIONS.M -> @M {
    say "Arguments: @M";
}

=end code

=head2 modules

A C<List> of strings of the C<-M> specifications to have considered
to have been given.

=begin code :lang<raku>

if $*RAKUDO-OPTIONS.modules -> @modules {
    say "Specified: @modules";
}

=end code

=head2 n

The command line parameter that indicates the program should be run
for each line of input.

=begin code :lang<raku>

say "Executing with -n" if $*RAKUDO-OPTIONS.n;

=end code

=head2 p

The command line parameter that indicates the program should be run
for each line of input, and that C<$_> should be printed after each
line of input.

=begin code :lang<raku>

say "Executing with -p" if $*RAKUDO-OPTIONS.p;

=end code

=head2 optimize

The command line parameter that indicates the optimization level.

=begin code :lang<raku>

say "Running with $_" with $*RAKUDO-OPTIONS.optimize;

=end code

=head2 program

The command line parameter that indicates the program to be executed.
Is either a string (in which case it is the name of the script to run)
or a C<List> consisting of C<-e> and the code to executed.

=begin code :lang<raku>

say "Running $*RAKUDO-OPTIONS.program";

=end code

=head2 profile

The command line parameter that indicates whether a profile should
be made, and what type.

=begin code :lang<raku>

say "Creating a profile with $_" with $*RAKUDO-OPTIONS.profile;

=end code

=head2 stagestats

The command line parameter that indicates whether stage statistics
should be shown while compiling.
